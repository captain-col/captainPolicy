# Define a new keyword to add a dependency to a target.  When you run make,
# CMT tries to be as parallel as possible, and so all of the targets get
# built "at once".  This means that if you build a library and an
# application in the same package, and the application uses the library (it
# almost always does), you need to specify the dependency relationship.
#
# If the requirements file looked like
#
# library myLib a.cxx bunch.cxx of.cxx files.cxx
#
# application myApp myApp.cxx
# dependency target=myApp depends=myLib
#
# Then myLib will be built before myApp

# Set up a make fragment to build the $(package)_version.hxx file.
# This gets included into a package requirements file with:
#
#  document version version *.cxx ../dict/*.cxx
#
# The include file will define macros for the package version, as well as
# ones to check if the version comes before a fixed version.  For example
# the captainPolicy definition macro names will be
#
#  captainPolicy_MAJOR_VERSION
#  captainPolicy_MINOR_VERSION
#  captainPolicy_PATCH_VERSION
#  BEFORE_captainPolicy(v,r,p)
#  EQUALS_captainPolicy(v,r,p)

# package requirements file with:

# Make sure that a version include file gets built.
